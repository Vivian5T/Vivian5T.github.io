For example, coffeehouse, hotel lobby, prime lounge and university hall are considered to be the reasonable places for expert interview, for the reason that to ensure the interviews can be take place equally, smoothly and successfully, the locations should be chosen with consideration of the social and political meaning involved in the places, as well as the information privacy and the rigour of the research. For business owner interview, personal studio, store and workplace are considered to be the appropriate locations, because conducting the interviews at relevant places to their business and familiar places will encourage the participants to talk freely in context and also fro interviewer, this will contribute to a better comprehension and interpreting. Regarding to the customer interview, the method is adopted to select locations is similar to the business owner interview, that the familiar places such as workplace, or other neutral places that the participants feel free and convenient(i.e. Coffeehouse and park). The other way is to conduct the interview through email or voice (or video) call which the questions will be sent in advance to provide and collecting the data through either email attachments or voice (or video) calls. Online questionnaire survey is to gather the general perceptions and preferences towards leather-craft and related products or services from public which is planned to involve roughly 100 citizens in China from 25-55. And the online questionnaire will be sent by website and social network platforms. Finally, the participant observation will involve 2 groups people totally about 5 people with employment from 25-45. The current craft consumers will be invited to be the participants. Their experience of visiting chosen craft shops and activities will be recorded and they also will be ask to answer a number of causal questions relating their experience.

As they play off against each other, their interactions determine how we think, make judgments and decisions, and act.” Note2 “Incredibly, the priming of actions and thoughts is completely unconscious; we do it without realizing.” Note3 “In a state of cognitive ease, the intuitive System 1 is in charge of our minds, and the logical and more energy-demanding System 2 is weakened. This means we are more intuitive, creative and happier, yet we’re also more likely to make mistakes. In a state of cognitive strain, our awareness is more heightened, and so System 2 is put in charge. System 2 is more ready to double-check our judgments than System 1, so although we are far less creative, we will make fewer mistakes.” Note4 “Priming, just like other societal elements, can influence an individual’s thoughts and therefore choices, judgment and behavior – and these reflect back into the culture and heavily affect the kind of society we all live in.” Section 3 Summary of Thinking Fast And SlowThe key message of this book is: Thinking, Fast and Slow shows us that our minds contain two systems. The first acts instinctively and requires little effort; the second is more deliberate and requires much more of our attention. Our thoughts and actions vary depending on which of the two systems is in control of our brain at the time.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[经常看到有人在书单上推荐日本作家奥野宣之的《如何有效阅读一本书——超实用笔记读书法》，好奇心下，忍不住就从网上入手了一本。 一拿到这本书，我立即就爱不释手，这不仅在于这本书简约、大气的装帧排版深得我心，更在于这本书的内容确实干货满满，深感奥野宣之真不愧为“笔记本作家”。 奥野宣：“一味读下去”等于没有读过。 看到这句话，我立马感觉汗颜，但又不得不赞同。想想自己几十年来，好歹也读了几百本书，许多书就是“一味读下去”的，虽然在当时感觉也很有收获的样子，可时间长了，书中到底讲了什么内容，现在让我回答，好像一下子又说不上来。 奥野宣之认为，“我们最需要铭记于心的关于读书的基本目标：读完每一本书，都能有扎实的收获。至于一个月能读很多书、读一本书只用几十分钟这样的能力，在这个目标前都是苍白无力的。” 为达到“读完每一本书都有扎实收获”的目标，奥野宣之独创了一元化笔记读书法，指导大家如何运用笔记本，来学习怎样选书、怎样读书和怎样把书中的内容刻在脑海里并加以活用，然后把这些做法转化为实用、可持续、属于自己的技巧。 他倡导有目的性地购书，注意在日常生活中收集线索，防止冲动购书或落入营销陷阱，让读书从一开始就充满主动性；用笔记管理读书生活，养成随时记录心得体会的习惯，将随想笔记成为创意之源；运用“葱鲔火锅式”摘抄法，将摘抄与评论交替进行，让原书精髓与自身思维的火花交相辉映；完善整理归档工作，方便检索，养成重读的习惯，通过思想输出来体现笔记的价值。此外，他还从自身经验出发介绍了19个让读书体验更充实的小技巧，甚至还贴心地附录了写读书笔记的26款实用文具。 在阅读这本书的过程中，我对照作者的建议，不停地检视自己的读书行为和读书方法，发现确有许多可以改进的地方。当然，每个人都有自己的阅读习惯和喜好，没必要完全照抄照搬。正如奥野宣之所说的：“读书的目的是用自己的方式学习，而不是模仿评论家的做法，学习、吸收对自己真正有用的智慧和语句才是最重要的。反过来说，如果有些信息对自己来说无关紧要，那就干脆丢掉。读书的重点是自己认为哪些内容重要，并将其彻底消化。” 所以，对于作者竭力推崇的纸质笔记本，我没有刻意去模仿，因为我觉得不适合自己。以前，自己也曾喜欢手工摘抄做笔记、做剪报，但时间长了，发现有一个缺点，就是查找资料不很方便，而且纸质笔记容易发黄变旧，不方便保存，还占用大量空间，所以我个人现在更喜欢通过扫描和云笔记，把各种剪报、文档做电子化处理。 下面，我将从选书、购书、读书、记录、活用、输出等几个方面来进行梳理，以期建立自己有效的知识管理体系，努力实现读书收益最大化。同时，也与您分享。 选书与购书 选书，是指“收集日常生活中所有与书相关的信息，记录自己想读和需要读的书，这样做可以减少与内容乏味，自己不感兴趣的书的接触，提高选书的‘命中率’”。 购书，是指“根据自己的需要，检查书籍本身是不是像笔记里写的那样值得购买”。作者在该书第二章中对此有详细讲述。 我的购书清单主要来自以下两个方面： 一是学习工作生活中所需或关注的内容。如果我要研究某一领域的内容，一般会先关注这一领域的大咖，先把TA的相关书籍读一遍，然后，通过参考文献，也就是奥野宣之所说的“书中书”，延伸阅读这一领域的其他相关专家的书籍。读书，我一般以读经典为主。我发现，当你认真研读完某一领域5-10本的经典书籍，再去看其他类似的书籍，你就会有“一览众山小”的感觉了，因为许多道理都是相通的，只是各人表述的方式和角度不同罢了。 二是通过各种渠道获得的推荐书单。以前主要通过报纸、杂志、书籍和电视等途径，现在更多的是借助网络，特别是豆瓣、简书、微信上看到的一些阅读书单，同时结合自己某一时期的兴趣爱好，以及有关购书网站上对书籍的相关介绍和评论，确定自己想要购买的书单。 购书清单，我一般是先记录在印象笔记里，然后在购书网站上直接搜索，并分3类保存：马上想看的，放入“购物车”；近期想看的，放入“收藏夹”；过段时间想看的，放入“心愿单”。将购书清单分类保存，可以避免清单变得过长而难以确认，而且放在“购物车”、“收藏夹”、“心愿单”的物品，是可以根据需要，随时相互转换的。 购书，奥野宣之偏好实体店，而我则更喜欢网购。不过，这些都无关紧要。要紧的是，无论在哪里购物，关键是要明确自己的购书清单，防止冲动购物，既浪费金钱，也浪费时间。对于难以确定的书籍，我常常会使用Kindle的发送样章功能，先预览下，再做决定。读书与记录 奥野宣之说，读书，是“在读的过程中做好写读书笔记的准备。将重要的部分按以下等级提炼出来：让我颇有感触的部分；纠结要不要做记号的部分；做了记号的部分；要摘抄到笔记里的段落。”记录，是“制作读书笔记，记录读书过程中产生的感动或思考，铭记这次读书体验，留下与书交流的证据。”作者在该书第三章中对此作了详细讲解。 为了把书中把最重要的内容筛选出来，作者提出了分阶段“筛选程序”。 通读：把读起来觉得不错的那一页折角； 重读：读完一遍以后，再把折角的几页重新读一遍。如果仍然觉得很好，就把那一页的另一个角也折起来。 标记：再重新读一遍折起上下两角的几页，如果第三次阅读后仍然觉得值得一读，就用笔在上面做记号。如图。 相较于作者在读书过程中的耐心和细致，自己的读书方式看上去有点“简单粗暴”。一直以来，我奉行“不动笔墨不读书”，而且特别注重第一次阅读的感觉，所以每当看到喜欢的内容（有趣、有感、有用）或有疑虑的地方，就忍不住拿起笔来涂涂抹抹，画上各种线条标记；即使在Kindle或手机上看书，也喜欢及时标记或复制摘录。 按说，自己的这种读书方式也不能说不好。但问题是，除非要应付考试，或者遇到特别喜欢或深奥的书籍，一般的书籍我就阅读一次，然后就束之高阁，很少再去认真重读。其中的原因，也许是因为过于自信自己的记忆力，认为看过了，当然就记住了；还有，自己的屯书速度远远超过阅读速度，所以一旦看完一本书，就得赶紧看下一本，要不然，家中的书柜就要溢出来了。有时候，有些书甚至只看了一半，就搁在那里一年半载，不去理它，因为我又有了新欢需要宠幸，哪里还顾得上旧爱呢。现在想来，真是罪过。 另外，我以前看书，除了在书中作一些标记外，并没有专门做读书笔记的习惯，因为觉得太烦，费时费力。这次看到作者在书中竭力推崇读书笔记的重要性，于是，我也试着在印象笔记上做了一次完整的读书记录。我发现，做读书笔记的时间，虽然比读一本书的时间还长，但笔记让读书成果一目了然，确实感觉很有成就感。 活用与输出 奥野宣之说，活用，就是“通过再次浏览读书笔记，在检索和参考的过程中，帮助自己获得智慧、得到提升。另一方面，制作笔记时要注意方便日后重读。”输出，就是通过口述或写作，向别人表达自己的想法。作者在该书第四章中对此有详细的阐述。 奥野宣之认为，当你为别人讲解书中的内容时，才会真正理解它。即使掌握再多信息，如果不去积极输出，也无法形成知识体系。积极输出可以促进思想内化。当你以思想输出为前提去读书时，思想输入的质量也会有所提升，而且亲手写文章的好处比口头叙述要多。 作者的这些话，读之如饮甘露，沁人心脾。 关于活用和输出，我的体会主要有两点： 一是做好随想笔记，及时记录灵感、思考和发现。任何时候，无论是在工作、生活中，还是在读书过程中，抑或是在发呆空想中，只要有灵感或思想火花闪现，一定要马上记下来，时间急的话，哪怕只记录下几个关键词，有空的时候再补充完善。因为“书面化的思考更便于利用”，思想的火花，如果没有及时记录下来，很容易随风飘散，想用的时候，可能再也找不到了。奥野宣之推崇的是把它记在纸质笔记本或便笺上，但对于我来说，感觉最方便的还是记在手机上：打开印象笔记，通过讯飞软件，用语音输入秒变转化成文字保存，有空的时候，再补充完善，并设置好相应的标签，方便以后查找。 二是注意收集、摘录各种有用的图文素材。对于报纸、杂志上看到的感兴趣的内容，我会用扫描全能王App，直接将纸质文档转化成电子PDF格式保存。对于在电脑或手机上看到的一些资讯，我会直接收藏至云盘或印象笔记里。最重要的是，要对保存的资料，每周进行定期整理、输出，只有这样，保存的信息才能转化为自己的知识和思想体系。 对于上述创作方式，奥野宣之在书里有一种很形象的比喻，我觉得特别贴切。他说：如果把读书过程比喻成做菜，那么“购书清单”就是购买食材，“写读书笔记”就是洗菜切菜，“通过读书笔记进行思想输出”就是开火炒菜。好的读书笔记就像认真洗好切好的蔬菜和鲜肉一样，可以随时拿出来根据需要进行输出。 以上是我阅读《如何有效阅读一本书——超实用笔记读书法》以后的活用与输出。 感谢您有耐心读完此文。如果对您有所帮助和启发，我会非常开心。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Mac使用了很多年了，对于不能在Mac下写入NTFS格式的磁盘，一直是一件让人觉得很不爽的事情，所以就去研究了一下。 解决办法 解决方法有如下三种: 第一种 应用软件 直接使用第三方软件，如 Paragon NTFS for MAC (需要软件的朋友移步本文软件分享部分)，Tuxera NTFS 等，不过大部分都是收费的。有一款免费的是 Mounty。 第二种 脚本命令 执行我写好的脚本，命令如下： $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CraryPrimitiveMan/code-examples/master/shell/mac_ntfs.sh $ chmod +x ./mac_ntfs.sh $ ./mac_ntfs.sh 注：执行时，需插入磁盘。期间要输入你的本地密码授权写文件，然后你会发现在桌面出现了一个Volumes的快捷方式，点进去，就可以看到你的磁盘了。执行完之后，需要重新插入磁盘。 第三种 脚本命令手动去开启 Mac 中隐藏的对NTFS的支持（OSX 10.5之后）。这个也需要线插上磁盘，然后可以从finder或者使用以下命令查看到磁盘的Volume Name： $ diskutil list 显示结果如下： /dev/disk0 (internal, physical): #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: GUID_partition_scheme *500.3 GB disk0 1: EFI EFI 209.7 MB disk0s1 2: Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD 499.4 GB disk0s2 3: Apple_Boot Recovery HD 650.0 MB disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual): #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: Apple_HFS Macintosh HD +499.1 GB disk1 Logical Volume on disk0s2 77AD0A71-82FD-4D1E-B074-CB1405FCD317 Unlocked Encrypted /dev/disk2 (external, physical): #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: FDisk_partition_scheme *1.5 TB disk2 1: Windows_NTFS TOSHIBA EXT 1.5 TB disk2s1 可以看到，我的磁盘的 Volume Name 是TOSHIBA EXT。紧接着更新 /etc/fstab文件 $ sudo vim /etc/fstab 把以下内容写入进去 $ LABEL=TOSHIBA\040EXT none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse 下面来依次解释一下，其中的\040的意思是代替空格键，因为我的Volume Name是有空格的，所以必须把这个空格给转义了。后面的Ntfs rw表示把这个分区挂载为可读写的ntfs格式，最后nobrowse非常重要，因为这个代表了在finder里不显示这个分区，这个选项非常重要，如果不打开的话挂载是不会成功的。 编辑好以后重新插入磁盘，就能识别到了，但是这个时候有了一个最大的问题，因为这个分区在finder里不显示了，那么我们要怎么找到它呢，总不能一直用命令行把，解决办法其实很简单，因为这个分区是挂/Volumes下的，我们把这个目录在桌面做一个快捷方式就行了。 $ sudo ln -s /Volumes ~/Desktop/Volumes 然后就可以在桌面上打开Volumes快捷方式，去使用了 软件分享Paragon NTFS for MAC 软件下载地址]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Ulysses Mac上优秀的文本写作编辑工具随着近两年 Markdown 语法的不断流行，与之关的各种编辑器也陆续浮出水面，其中以 Mac 平台上的数量最为可观，但由此带来的还有让用户纠结不已的竞争关系。说到竞争关系，自然要谈到 Markdown 编辑器的代表作，我认为可以胜任此「头衔」的有：Ulysses, Byword, Mou 和 iA Writer Pro。但是，我更加确信，Ulysses III 绝对是一款不可复制的成功佳作，这就是为什么我要将它放在第一位置，同时也是为什么专业用户都一致推荐它的原因。根据实际体验，与其说 Ulysses 是个富有创造性功能的应用，倒不如称它为融合了各类 Markdown 编辑器特点的集合体。 用户界面 主题，这可是 Ulysses 的亮点功能。除了自带的几款，还可以直接在官网下载更多主题样式，我个人经常用的是 Blue Screen 和 Esme’s Delight，前者能让我提神，还能让周围的人产生错觉；后者倾向文艺、清淡，可以让我安静地码字。而且我还发现，一款主题能同时兼容黑暗主题和非黑暗主题，除非制作者没有这方面考虑。 专注！专注！专注！ 这个词眼儿已经不新鲜了，因为在 Byword 中也有同名功能。相比在 Ulysses 中的表现，两者其实相差无几，只不过 Ulysses 方面会跟随主题改变而 Byword 不行。那么什么是「专注模式」呢？我认为，大致表现在这些特征上：打字机滚动、突出显示当前行、显示段落号。 预览和导出 不同于实时预览的代表作 Mou，Ulysses 其实更加注重码字的过程而不是结果，但即使如此，它依然有较好的「预览」体验。为了满足不同用户的需求，开发商还特意丰富了「导出」功能，实在让人不得不好评一番！ 先来说说默认方案，Ulysses 自带了「预览」功能，组合键设定为 ⌘⇧P 开关（⌘R 为刷新预览）。一般情况下，用户可以直接选择 HTML 和 PDF 两种预览方式，再根据文章类型的识别，还可以通过 ePub 预览。当选择好其一后，我们还可以选择不同的字体，用以在不同格式的条件下，控制排面的布局。对普通用户而言，自带的「预览」已足够使用；不过Ulysses还支持的跟多类型文件输出：纯文本、富文本、HTML 和 ePub 四种。每一种导出方式还有不同的细分，比如富文本导出包括：PDF, TextEdit, Word；ePub 导出会要求添加封面图片等。 更多特性 相比以往的应用，Ulysses 的特色功能不仅有趣，还更加实用。首先要介绍的是「目标」设定，该功能相当于达标状态指示，即用户预先设置一个目标，然后以此为目的，去达成。但实际体验下来，我觉得缩略图标就足够满足我对了解当前写作进度的需要了。 软件分享Ulysses 软件下载地址 密码: yumy]]></content>

    <url>%2F2016%2F06%2F10%2FMac%E7%A5%9E%E5%99%A8--%E3%80%8E%20Alfred%203.0%20%E3%80%8F%E6%96%B0%E7%89%88%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[这是一篇详细介绍 Mac 效率启动器 Alfred 3.0 新版的文章，如果你之前不怎么熟悉 Alfred，建议阅读本文之前先阅读《Alfred 详解与使用技巧》这篇文章，这会让你更快弄懂 3.0 新版的各项新特性和改进。 效率神器对大多数 Mac 用户来说，有不少 Mac 软件是无论如何都会被「安利」的，甚至在某种程度上它们会成为很多人购买 Mac 的理由。如果你是少数派的老读者的话，相信你已经无数次在这里看到过它们的名字，比如 Alfred，OmniFocus，Ulysses…… 这些 Mac 软件都有着无数竞品，但它们是各自领域中当之无愧的「王者」应用。OmniFocus 是 GTD 工具中最早步上神坛的软件，Ulysses 则是在近年中占据了Markdown写作应用的头把交椅，而Alfred却是Mac上最好的效率软件。 “I used to be a Windows user, but now I buy a Mac for Alfred.” 作为Mac上最强大的效率工具，Alfred早已不仅仅是最开始的快速启动与搜索工具，它的 workflow扩展功能，让它成为了一个拥有无限自动化潜力的「工具台」软件，你可以用它来实现你的一切有关自动化的想法。下面这张官方图中标出了Alfred的所有功能，从中你可以直观的感受到它的强大。 前段时间，Alfred正式更新了它的3.0版本，带来了更为强大的功能和对普通用户更为友好的设计，让Mac Power User与普通用户的距离变得更近了——在这个新版本里，除了全新的剪贴板与快捷输入功能以外，Alfred最为核心的Workflow扩展功能被开发商进行了更为深度的模块化设计，把很多原本需要通过写代码才能实现的功能直接制作成了模块，用户只需要简单的设置就可以快速的设计出一个全新的Workflow。 瑞士军刀并不万能，万能的是一把可以无限添加部件的瑞士军刀。 终于自由的自定义主题在 Alfred 2 中，自定义主题一直都是一个非常鸡肋的功能。 我们如果要自己设置一个Alfred的主题，只能够通过Command、Ctrl、Option 三个键与鼠标左键结合，通过点击循环更改字体，字体大小与结果列表的行间距，且这三个属性的可选范围是被限制在几个预置的选项中的。这样操作非常的麻烦且可选范围狭窄，并不能真正意义上自定义出用户想要的主题。 在 Alfred 3 中，开发商终于将这个功能做到了完善，我们可以使用任意 Mac 中已安装的字体，结果列表的间距以及字体的大小也可以通过拖动来设置成任意的大小，而除了原本的颜色和透明度自定义以外，开发商可还添加了毛玻璃模糊程度调节选项。 这一次，你终于可以真正的自由修改你的 Alfred 的界面了。 支持类型更丰富的剪贴板增强剪贴板记录扩展工具，长期以来都是 Mac 上的一大类软件，且往往售价也都不便宜，之前 Alfred 一直都只是有一个比较基础的剪贴板功能，仅支持文字的复制纪录，并无法代替传统的剪贴板软件。 而这次 Alfred 3 带来了全新的剪贴板功能，正式向传统剪贴板工具吹响了进攻的号角——我要开始抢你们的饭碗了。 Alfred 3 的剪贴板扩展支持所有类型文件的复制历史保存，从文字到 Doc 文档，从 Gif 图片到 .dmg 文件，你的所有复制历史都会被忠实的记录下来。 除了强大的记录能力，Alfred 3 的剪贴板功能还有着强大的预览能力，文字类型的复制历史除了显示内容之外还会显示一个字数统计，图像类型的复制历史都是直接可以在剪贴板历史中进行预览的1，而对于文档类复制历史如 PDF ，则更是提供了直接预览，并支持在预览中查看并翻页。 野心勃勃的短语快捷输入在 Alfred 2 中，Snippets（短语）这个功能就有存在，不过是作为剪贴板的附属功能而已，你只能通过剪贴板来调用，相比 TextExpander 这类老牌键盘加速软件，实在是差了不止一点半点。 Alfred 3 将这个功能单独剥离了出来，并带来了「自动扩展」能力，现在你可以通过给 Snippets 设定的关键词，直接在任意软件中通过输入关键词来触发文本自动扩展，实现的效果与 TextExpander 等老牌键盘加速软件的基础功能已经无异。 不过 Alfred 的开发商看起来还是对这个功能遮遮掩掩，想要使用它需要费一番手脚。Sippets 自动扩展功能在 Alfred 3 默认关闭，你需要打开 Alfred 的设置，在「Feature」菜单下的「Snippets」一项中将「Automatically expand snippets by keyword」勾选并按照指示将 Alfred 添加为辅助功能中的一项，方可打开。 接着，将你需要的 Snippets 分组添加到 Alfred，比如你常用的邮箱就可以添加为 Snippets 以「;em」这样的关键词来快速输入，同时 Alfred 3 还支持{time}、{date}、{clipboard} 这样的变量参数，写在 Snippets 的内容中可以在文本输出时显示为当时的时间、日期和剪贴板内容。如果你暂时想不到应该添加一些什么，你还可以添加按钮边上的「Get Collections」来添加 Alfred 官方推荐的 Snippets。 注意，Alfred 3 仍然保持了了部分二代的设计思路，它的 Snippets 并不是在你打开自动扩展之后就默认都会自动扩展的，你需要在想要自动扩展的 Snippets 的「A→」一栏中勾选才行。 深度模块化的 Workflow这一次 Alfred 更新最大的就是 Workflow 功能。作为 Alfred 的核心功能，Workflow 为 Alfred 带来了无与伦比的可扩展性，并让 Alfred 成为了几乎可以完成一切自动化的终极效率工具。Alfred 的 Workflow 功能支持 JavaScript、AppleScript、bash、zsh、PHP、Ruby、Python 以及Perl，并且类似iOS系统上的 Workflow 应用，提供各种程序模块来让用户像搭乐高积木一样的来搭建自己的 Workflow。 在 Alfred 2 中 Workflow 功能已经非常的强大，但大多数功能贴心好用的 Workflow 还是主要由程序语言来实现，且在编辑过程中有着诸多的不方便2。 这一次，在吸取了二代经验之后，Alfred 3 对 Workflow 的易用性进行了彻底的设计，添加了大量的新程序模块，并让图形化编辑过程尽可能的贴近普通用户习惯，加入了程序块的自由拖拽，同时还新增了注释功能以及颜色标注，让 Workflow 尽可能的摆脱编程的束缚。 Alfred 3 一共新增了 10 个新的模块，上图中以红色标出的即是新增的功能模块，其中 8 个模块组成了一个全新的模块大类「Utilities」，也就是实用工具模块大类。 这 8 个模块分别是： - Arg / Var 变量设定模块，可以将当前的输入值赋值给一变量，类似 iOS 上 Workflow 应用的 Set Variable 动作，在之后的流程中可反复调用。 - Filter 条件过滤模块，相当于 if...then... 条件语句，通过判断条件值来选择是否执行下一步。 - JSON Config 数据存储模块，可以将变量等数据以 JSON 格式存储起来。 - Junction 整理模块，可以将多条输入整理在一个节点处再分发出去，降低 Workflow 流程图中的线条复杂度。 - Delay 延时触发模块，可以将后续流程延后执行。 - Transform 文字处理模块，可以对输入的字符串进行诸如去掉空格，全转为大写等操作。 - Replace 替换模块，可以将目标变量或字符替换为所需变量或字符。 - Bug 程序错误查找模块，可以让你对单个步骤的运行情况进行分析。 这八个全新模块的加入，给 Alfred 的 Workflow 创建的难度带来了本质性的改变，特别是 Arg／Var ，Filter，Delay三个模块，将变量、条件语句以及延迟三种在编辑 Workflow 中经常要用到，但却又需要编程知识才能实现的功能，直接变成了可简单拖拽组合的模块。通过这几个新增模块，你不需要懂编程也可以快速编辑一个简单的 Workflow 了。 剩下两个新加入的模块分别是「File Filter」和「Dictionary Filter」，是对原本过滤器模块大类的补充，分别支持设定文件类型和目录等来搜索文件，以及支持设定语言来搜索 OS X 内置词典。 对于一个普通的用户来说，利用现有的新模块建立一个 Workflow 相比以前简单了太多，很多情况下不需要写任何一行代码就可以完成。普通用户或许不会从头写一个 Alfred 的 Workflow ，但修改别人的 Workflow 来适应自己的工作流也变简单了，让普通用户去结合自身需求使用 Workflow 的门槛大大减小。下面是官方给出的一个「待办事项列表」Workflow 的结构图，全部由模块组成并附有详细的说明，整个过程一目了然。 总结作为老牌效率软件，Alfred 的这次大版本升级，隐隐有集各大效率软件功能于一身的趋势。除了基础的功能扩展变多之外，Workflow 编辑的易读性与模块化让 Alfred 的功能扩展变得更为友好，虽然仍旧需要基础的编程思维，但对编程语言的需求已经大大减小，向着「效率用户的乐高工具箱」又前进了一大步。 你需要剪贴板扩展？Alfred 3 可以满足你。你需要类似 TextExpander 那样的短语自动扩展软件？Alfred 3 可以满足你。你不懂编程语言但是想建立自己的一个自动处理 Workflow ？Alfred 3 也可以满足你。 Mac 上最强的效率「工具台」应用，无出其右。这顶小帽子，早已不仅仅是一个效率启动器。 软件分享Alfred 3.0 软件下载地址 密码: 2f5h]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[『RIME』调效笔记-转自简书作者：scomper 原文地址 最开始只是想调整一下鼠须管的界面风格，让它变得小清新一点，结果周末的时间就都掉到鼠须管配置的这个「坑」里，改完了界面接着想解决候选词乱码的问题，然后是模糊拼音、扩充词库、表情输入、符号输入、特殊符号直接上屏等需求接踵而来。鼠须管官网的介绍其实已经很全面了，还提供了很多参照代码。但是设置的过程毕竟不是友好的图形界面，需要打开「用户设定」目录下的具体文件修改代码部分，所以过程并不顺畅，即便是简单的复制和粘贴，也要考虑语法缩进的问题。在没有更好的图形化配置界面出来以前，注定鼠须管是一个有一定学习成本的输入法，而要让它更好用只能学习并调教它。 基本的调教并没有想象中的那么复杂，看完官网的帮助后就可以动手试试。由鼠须管的图标中选择「用户设定」（~/Library/Rime/）定位到具体文件，修改完成再执行一次「重新部署」就能看到修改后的效果。 方案特点：支持 /dn 方式的符号输出；常见拼写的容错处理；输入字母 v 开头的短语输出颜文字；词义关联模式的表情符号；#、`、符号直接上屏；单引号输出「」；- +以及\&lt; &gt; 键翻页；上下箭头选择其他候选； 包含常用汉语、诗词和英文的词典。 如果你平时用的就是「明月拼音·简化字」，可以跳过后续具体配置的介绍直接到文章最后下载附件，解压缩并将其中的文件放到「用户设定」目录「重新部署」即可。 配置文件和基本思路鼠须管的「用户设定」文件夹里包含很多文件，根据自己的输入要求定制的时候实际上涉及的文件只有固定的几个，一些是调整输入法外观和参数的，还有一大部份是扩展词库的文件。 配置输入法的的外观和特性的几个文件： squirrel.custom.yaml ，自定义皮肤； default.custom.yaml ，设定备选词数量，定义输入方案； luna _pinyin simp.custom.yaml ，定义扩充词库、加载符号库、模糊拼音。明月拼音·简化字的输入方案配置文件，明月拼音对应的文件就是 luna\pinyin___.custom.yaml； installation.yaml，定义配置文件保存到 Dropbox 文件夹 以上几个以 .custom.yaml 作为后缀的文件，意味着是以补丁的方式来实现个性化定制的，输入法后续升级不会覆盖这些文件。所以自定义的文件配置中起始部分都会有patch:的字段，每个配置文件中有且只需要一行这个代码段。扩展词库涉及到的几个配置文件，参照扩展词库的内容，你可以自己定义类似的词库： luna_pinyin.extended.dict.yaml，扩展词库主文件，其他词库都需要在这个主文件中定义才能被调用，如果不想加载某个词库在此文件中注释掉即可（在所在行前加 # 井号） luna_pinyin.cn_en.dict.yaml，英文、中英文混合短语和名词 luna_pinyin.computer.dict.yaml，计算机术语 luna_pinyin.emoji.dict.yaml，表情符号 luna_pinyin.hanyu.dict.yaml，汉语大词典 luna_pinyin.kaomoji.dict.yaml，颜文字表情符号 luna_pinyin.movie.dict.yaml，电影名称 luna_pinyin.music.dict.yaml，音乐和歌曲名 luna_pinyin.name.dict.yaml，人名 luna_pinyin.poetry.dict.yaml，唐诗宋词、千家集、楚辞、诗经 词库文件是相对单独的，鼠须管中挂载词库的方式比以前更灵活，而且编辑起来也很方便，在luna\_pinyin.extended.dict.yaml这个词库主文件中定义和关联其他词库，而扩展词库的加载则是由 luna\_pinyin\_simp.custom.yaml这个文件来决定。 扩展词库文件被修改后需要「重新部署」才能生效。 鼠须管的配置中，重要的是主要外观和特性文件的设置，第一步是修改default.custom.yaml 确定你的输入方案，也就是按「control+` 」时出现的可供选择的明月拼音、明月拼音·简化字、五笔等；第二步是修改输入法的外观 squirrel.custom.yaml；第三步就是修改你的输入方案的配置文件，例如：明月拼音·简化字，那么只需要修改luna\_pinyin\_simp.custom.yaml，输入方案的配置文件像是一个接口文件，模糊拼音、加载扩充词库、定义一些特殊符号的直接上屏、定义个性化的翻页按键等都在这个文件里。安装完鼠须管后，用户文件夹里可能看不到上述提到的这些文件，简单的办法就是复制一个同样后缀的文件然后对照修改。下载的词库或配置文件中也可能直接包含这样的文件，如果从不同来源下载的文件中包含同样命名的文件，最好对照一下内容，不要盲目覆盖导致配置丢失。 luna_pinyin.extended.dict.yaml词库部署的过程就是下载扩充词库（登录页面后点击右下角的「Download ZIP」），下载完成后解压缩并将 luna\_pinyin.dict 中的文件复制到你的「用户设定」目录。假如你和我一样是使用「明月拼音·简化字」，就不用复制文件夹中的double\_pinyin.custom.yaml这个文件。复制完成后重命名luna\_pinyin.custom.yaml为luna\_pinyin\_simp.custom.yaml。如果这个文件已经存在，那么需要将下载文件luna\_pinyin.custom.yaml中的内容合并到已有luna\_pinyin\_simp.custom.yaml文件当中。英文常用词库（luna_pinyin.cn_en.dict.yaml）里自己尝试添加了一个 osx ☞ OS X，第一次失败是因为间隔之间没有用 tab 键，而是用空格，第二次失败是因为音节之间没有正确空格，正确的规则是「文字-编码-权重频度」三个字段之间是 tab，编码如果是多个「音节」音节之间用空格分开，权重数值的高低决定了音节相同时多个候选词在候选条上排列的先后顺序，当然全局性的词频拥有更高的优先级（候选条上高亮选中，然后 shift+fn+delete 可以删除记忆错误的词频调整）。 编辑字典文件时，TextWrangler 编辑器可以「View-Text Display-Show Invisibles」将隐藏符号显示出来以便查错和参照。TextWrangler 「Edit - Text Options」设置里去掉「Auto-expend tabs」的勾选，输出的就是tab而不是4个空格。表情符号的问题，有几种解决方案， 一种是把表情作为输入方案的一种选择，需要的时候像切换繁体和简体一样切换到表情输入； 另一种是将表情加入到拼音方案中，但是这种方式每次都出来一堆表情，而且没法实现词频的调整，所以最后选择的是将表情作为字典来使用的方案， 基于网友 @ lembacon 的表情文件制作了一份字典文件（luna_pinyin.emoji.dict.yaml，已包含在文章后的下载中），需要注意的是新的表情字典，需要在扩展字典的主文件（luna_pinyin.extended.dict.yaml）中添加一段代码：- luna\_pinyin.emoji。 name: luna_pinyin.extended version: &quot;2014.10.28&quot; sort: by_weight use_preset_vocabulary: 此處爲明月拼音擴充詞庫（基本）默認鏈接載入的詞庫，有朙月拼音官方詞庫、明月拼音擴充詞庫（漢語大詞典）、明月拼音擴充詞庫（詩詞）、明月拼音擴充詞庫（含西文的詞彙）。如果不需要加載某个詞庫請將其用「#」註釋掉。 雙拼不支持 luna_pinyin.cn_en 詞庫，請用戶手動禁用。 import_tables: luna_pinyin luna_pinyin.hanyu luna_pinyin.poetry luna_pinyin.cn_en luna_pinyin.emoji luna_pinyin.kaomoji luna_pinyin.music luna_pinyin.movie luna_pinyin.computer luna_pinyin.name… default.custom.yaml全局性的这个文件里，主要是定义输入方案和候选词的数量，输入方案上我选择了：明月拼音·简化字、明月拼音、明月拼音·语句流、五笔拼音混合輸入，候选词数量设置的是7个（page_size: 7）。 patch: switcher: caption: 〔方案选单〕 hotkeys: - Control+grave menu: page_size: schema_list: - schema: luna_pinyin_simp - schema: luna_pinyin - schema: luna_pinyin_fluency - schema: wubi_pinyin # 五笔拼音混合輸入 squirrel.custom.yaml输入法外观的设定是在梁海方案的基础上修改的，并参照了 10.11 El Capitan 输入法的配色和字体。候选词条中如果出现生僻字无法显示（显示为框问号），可以在方案配色的字体指向上多加一个「 花园明朝」字体。 patch: show_notifications_when: appropriate # 状态通知，适当(appropriate)，开（always）关（never） style: color_scheme: apathy preset_color_schemes: apathy: name: &quot;冷漠 / Apathy&quot; author: &quot;LIANG Hai &quot; horizontal: # 水平排列 inline_preedit: #单行显示，false双行显示 candidate_format: &quot;%c\u2005%@\u2005&quot; # 编号 %c 和候选词 %@ 前后的空间 corner_radius: #候选条圆角 border_height: border_width: back_color: 0xFFFFFF #候选条背景色 font_face: &quot;PingFangSC-Regular,H-SiuNiu&quot; #候选词字体 font_point: #候选字词大小 text_color: 0x424242 #高亮选中词颜色 label_font_face: &quot;PingFangSC-Light&quot; #候选词编号字体 label_font_point: #候选编号大小 hilited_candidate_text_color: 0xEE6E00 #候选文字颜色 hilited_candidate_back_color: 0xFFF0E4 #候选文字背景色 comment_text_color: 0x999999 #拼音等提示文字颜色 外观设置中指向了 El Capitan 最新的字体「苹方」和「 花园明朝」，后者需要单独下载安装。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[摘要：这是一篇关于自己搭建Github page的记录，内容包括github和Hexo设置等过程。我想将我搭建独立博客的过程在一篇文章中尽可能详细地写出来，希望也能给后来者一个有益的指引。 关于本人本人为一名视觉设计师，没有任何代码基础；作为一名技术小白，网上的各种也是搞的云里雾里，各种莫名其妙。。。可见做一名“程序员”还真是一件非常之不易的事情！所以，在我搭建完成自己的博客以后，我决定要将整个过程记录下来，其中有的资料可能引用他人的文章，在本文的最后我也将列出参考资料，并感谢！ 为啥要搭建自己的博客 属于独立&amp;自己的空间，不用受各种框架的限制。 自我的展示&amp;分享平台。 为啥用Github Page? 免费当然是最大的吸引力！－300M的Free空间，资料独立管理。 可以绑定自己域名、支持静态脚本、DIY自由发挥！ 顺带学习如何使用Github为自己的工作增效！ 拓展自己的眼界，多见多学总是好的！ 关于Github Page Git：一个开源分布式版本控制系统，用以有效、高速的处理从很小到非常大的项目版本管理。 Github：一个托管课中Git库的站点 安装工具 Git Node.js 技术基础 html+css+javascript git基本语法 markdown语法 gdfgdfgdfg Github创建仓库 登录github账号：在github首页点击Sign in按钮进入登录页面。填写用户名或邮箱和密码，点击Sign in按钮登录。 点击创建仓库：点击在登录的用户图像左边的+号和下三角符号按钮。 填写创建仓库信息。 填写好相关信息，点击Create repository(创建仓库)按钮。 配置SSH 首先我们需要检查你电脑上现有的ssh key,打开终端： 1$ cd ~/. ssh 检查本机的ssh密钥 如果提示：No such file or directory 说明你是第一次使用git。 生成新的SSH Key： 123$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;邮件地址@youremail.com&quot;Generating public/private rsa key pair.Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/your_user_directory/.ssh/id_rsa): 注意: 此处的邮箱地址，你可以输入自己的邮箱地址；注意2: 此处的「-C」的是大写的「C」 然后系统会要你输入密码： 12Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):&lt;输入加密串&gt;Enter same passphrase again:&lt;再次输入加密串&gt; 到这里就成功设置ssh key了 添加公钥到github： 点击用户头像，然后点击显示的Settings(设置)选项； 在用户设置栏，点击SSH and GPG keys选项，然后点击New SSH key(新建SSH)按钮； 把你本地生成的密钥复制到里面（key文本框中）， 点击add key就ok了 测试SSH： 1$ ssh -T git@github.com 接下来会出来下面的确认信息： 123The authenticity of host &apos;github.com (207.97.227.239)&apos; can&apos;t be established.RSA key fingerprint is 17:24:ac:a5:76:28:24:36:62:1b:36:4d:eb:df:a6:45.Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 输入yes后回车。 然后显示如下信息则OK(其中的Vivian5T是用户名)。 12Hi Vivian5T! You&apos;ve successfully authenticated,but GitHub does not provide shell access. 安装HEXO1$ npm install -g hexo 部署HEXO在电脑中建立一个名字叫“Blog”的文件夹，然后打开终端进入该文件夹目录 1$ cd blog 初始化&amp;建立“HEXO”所需文件 1$ hexo init 现在我们已经搭建起本地的hexo博客了。本地预览已经建立的博客，执行以下命令，然后到浏览器输入localhost:4000看看。 12$ hexo generate$ hexo serve 安装HEXO主题首先执行清理缓存 1$ hexo clean 到Hexo theme选择一个自己喜欢的主题克隆到本地。 1$ git clone https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next themes/next 启用主题当克隆完成后，打开站点配置文件_config.yml， 找到theme字段，并将其值更改为next。 调试主题首先启动Hexo本地站点$ hexo serve，并开启调试模式（即加上--debug），整个命令是hexo serve --debug。 在服务启动的过程，注意观察命令行输出是否有任何异常信息，如果你碰到问题，这些信息将帮助他人更好的定位错误。 当命令行输出中提示出： 1INFO Hexo is running at http://0.0.0.0:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop. 此时即可使用浏览器访问http://localhost:4000，检查站点是否正确运行。 搭建完成！至此，独立博客就算搭建完成，如需进步一完善请在参看以下文章。 参考文章： 如何搭建一个独立博客——简明Github Pages与Hexo教程 - 简书 手把手教从零开始在GitHub上使用Hexo搭建博客教程(一)-附GitHub注册及配置]]></content>
